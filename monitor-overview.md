# Preparing monitors for a deployment
{: #mo-config}

Set up and enable monitors for each deployment that you are tracking with {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Selecting a deployment
{: #mo-deploy}

1.  First, you must select a deployment.

    If there are multiple deployments for a given model, then when you configure one deployment, all other deployments for the same model also get configured.
    {: note}

    ![Select deployment page](images/config-select-deploy.png)

1.  Select the *Prepare for monitoring* tile, and click **Begin**.

    ![Prepare for monitoring](images/config-prep-monitor.png)

## Working with data
{: #mo-data}

1.  Now you will provide information about your model and training data; click **Next**.

    ![Prepare explanation](images/config-what-monitor.png)

1.  From the drop-down menu, select the type of data your deployment analyzes, and click **Next**.

    ![Select input type](images/config-input-monitor.png)

### Numeric/categorical data
{: #mo-datan}

For numeric or categorical data, you need to provide information about the training data for your model, in order to configure the monitors.

  ![Select config type](images/config-manual-monitor.png)

- **Manually configure monitors** - Requires you to provide connection information to your training data.

    - Select the [algorithm type](/docs/services/ai-openscale-icp?topic=ai-openscale-icp-acc-monitor#acc-understand), and click **Next**:

      ![Multi-class](images/multiclass.png)

      Please ensure that the format of the training data is exactly the same as that expected by your model. For example, if the model expects `M` and `F` for the feature *Gender* then the training data should have `M` and `F`, not `Male` and `Female`. Currently {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} supports Db2 database or Cloud Object Storage locations only.
        {: important}

    - Specify the Location (either `Db2` or `Cloud Object Storage`), then:

        - For a Db2 database, complete the following:

            - Host name or IP address
            - Port
            - Database (name)
            - Username
            - Password

            ![Specify Db2 location of training data page](images/config-train-db2-monitor.png)

        - For Cloud Object Storage, complete the following:

            - Log-in URL

              The Login URL must match the region setting of the bucket where your training data is located. You will specify the training data bucket in the next step.
              {: important}

            - Resource instance (ID)
            - API key

            ![Specify Cloud Object Storage location of training data page](images/config-train-cos-monitor.png)

    - Ensure a valid connection by clicking the **Test** button to connect to the training data. Click **Next**.

    - Specify the exact location in the Db2 database or Cloud Object Storage where the training data is located.

        - For a Db2 database, select both a schema and a training table that includes columns expected by your model:

          ![Specify Db2 location of schema and training table](images/fair-config-table-db2.png)

        - For Cloud Object Storage, select a Bucket and a Data Set:

          ![Specify Cloud Object Storage location of data set](images/fair-config-dset-cos.png)

          Click **Next** to proceed to Step 5 below.

- **Upload a configuration file** - Choose this option if you prefer to keep your training data private. You can use a custom Python notebook to provide {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} with information to analyze your training data without providing access to the training data itself.

  Running the Python notebook lets you capture distinct values in the schema columns, as well as the column names. In addition, you can use the notebook to pre-configure the Fairness monitor.

    - Download the [custom notebook ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Watson/aios-data-distribution/blob/master/training_statistics_notebook.ipynb){: new_window}, and replace any credentials with your own credentials.

    - Review the notebook carefully, specifying data for your model where appropriate. Save the notebook.

    - Run the notebook to generate a JSON-formatted configuration file.

    - Upload the JSON configuration file.

        ![Upload config JSON](images/config-json-monitor.png)

    - Click **Next**.

- {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} will locate your training data from the metadata stored with the model in WML. Choose the label column in the training data that contains your prediction values and click **Next**.

  ![Select column label](images/fair-config-column.png)

- (**SPSS-only**) Select columns with a probability value, from the output data. Note that there may be more than one. Click **Next**.

    ![Select probability label](images/explain-prob-column.png)

- Select the columns used to train the model - these are the features that your model deployment expects in a request. Click **Next**.

    ![Select feature label](images/explain-select-column.png)

- Finally, select the columns that contained text, and have been converted to integers. For example, if the original training data contained `Male` and `Female` for *Gender*, and they have now been mapped to `0` and `1` respectively, the training data now contains `0` and `1` values for the *Gender* column. Identify such columns which now contain integers, but originally contained text values. Click **Next**.

    ![Select data table](images/explain-text-column.png)

### Images and Unstructured text
{: #mo-datai}

- **Images**

  For models that accept images as input, the image needs to be represented as a (height) x (width) x (# channels) format, where each point represents either monochrome or RGB values for each pixel.

- **Unstructured text**

   For models that accept text as input, it is expected that the model accepts the entire text, and not a vectorized representation of the text.

## Review and save configuration
{: #mo-save}

Review your selection summary and click **Save** to continue.

For SPSS-binary subscriptions, you must make another [payload logging (scoring) request](/docs/services/ai-openscale-icp?topic=ai-openscale-icp-cdb-connect#cdb-scoring) after clicking **Save**, before you begin configuring monitors. This ensures that [Explainability](/docs/services/ai-openscale-icp?topic=ai-openscale-icp-ie-ov#ie-ov) will be accurate.

## Next steps
{: #mo-next}

To begin configuring monitors, select a category and click **Begin**.
